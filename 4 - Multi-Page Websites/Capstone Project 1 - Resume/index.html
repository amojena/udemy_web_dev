    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I personally don't believe in summaries in resume. But, here we go. 
        I am looking to (maybe) become a freelancing web developer. I like
        the idea of making cool websites but what little I've experienced
        doing the smallest web dev I haven't liked it. I think it's because
        I've never taken the time to properly learn it. So hopefully after
        this course I will like it and start freelancing on the side to see
        if it's something I like.
